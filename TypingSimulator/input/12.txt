Each signal is defined as a unique (small) integer, starting sequentially from 1. These integers are defined in <signal.h> with
symbolic names of the form SIGxxxx. Since the actual numbers used for each signal vary across implementations, it is these
symbolic names that are always used in programs. For example, when the user types the interrupt character, SIGINT (signal number
2) is delivered to a process.
