On a stand-alone system, all the password information resides in the file /etc/passwd.
However, if we are using a system such as Network Information System (NIS) or Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to distribute passwords in a network environment, part
or all of this information resides on a remote system. As long as programs accessing
password information employ the functions described later in this chapter (getpwnam(),
getpwuid(), and so on), the use of NIS or LDAP is transparent to applications. Similar
comments apply regarding the shadow password and group files discussed in the following
sections.
