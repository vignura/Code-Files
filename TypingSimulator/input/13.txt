Signals fall into two broad categories. The first set constitutes the traditional or standard signals, which are used by the
kernel to notify processes of events. On Linux, the standard signals are numbered from 1 to 31. We describe the standard
signals in this chapter. The other set of signals consists of the realtime signals, whose differences from standard signals are
described in Section 22.8. A signal is said to be generated by some event. Once generated, a signal is later delivered to a
process, which then takes some action in response to the signal. Between the time it is generated and the time it is delivered,
a signal is said to be pending.
