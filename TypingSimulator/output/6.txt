Consider a working day in the office. Let us assume a developer is working on a long-term project. The manager
then gives the developer a new task, which is more important. The developer places the long-term project aside
and begins work on the new task. The phone then rings, this is the highest priority, as it must be answered
immediately. The developer pushes the present task into the pending tray and answers the phone. When the call
is complete, the task abandoned to answer the phone is retrived from the pending tray and work progresses. If
another call comes in, it may have to be handled in the same manner, but eventually the new task will be
finished, and the developer can draw the long-term project from the pending tray and continue with that.
