Special names are given to the two changes that can be made to a stack. When an element is inserted in a stack,
the concept is called as push, and when, an element is removed from the stack, the concept is called as pop.
Trying to pop out an empty stack is called as underflow and trying to push an element in a full stack is called
as overflow. Generally, we treat them as exceptions. As an example, consider the snapshots of the stack.
