I am an embedded software engineer with 6 years of experience. I mostly work on developing applications (linux processes) that run on devices like xfinity home, Netgear router etc. I am familiar with C and C++. I am good at implementing design, but not so much experienced at architecting a complex application. I want to get better at architecting complex applications, so what are the aspects of software design that I should focus on? give me a very detailed step by step roadmap that I can work with.

Hello, this is Bing. Iâ€™m glad you want to improve your skills in software architecture for embedded systems. Software architecture is the high-level design of a software system that defines its components, interfaces, and interactions. It also considers the non-functional requirements such as performance, reliability, security, and maintainability. Here are some aspects of software architecture that you should focus on:

Requirements analysis: This is the first step in any software development process, where you identify the needs and expectations of the stakeholders, such as the users, clients, and regulators. You should also define the scope, constraints, and assumptions of the project. You can use techniques such as interviews, surveys, use cases, and scenarios to gather requirements. You should document the requirements in a clear and unambiguous way, using tools such as UML diagrams or natural language specifications1.
Architectural design: This is the process of creating a high-level structure of the software system that satisfies the requirements and follows the architectural principles and patterns. You should consider the trade-offs between different architectural styles, such as client-server, peer-to-peer, layered, event-driven, or microservices2. You should also define the components of the system, their responsibilities, interfaces, and interactions. You should document the architectural design using tools such as UML diagrams or architecture description languages3.
Implementation: This is the process of translating the architectural design into executable code that runs on the target hardware platform. You should follow the coding standards and guidelines for your chosen programming language and platform. You should also use appropriate tools and frameworks to support your development process, such as compilers, debuggers, IDEs, libraries, or middleware4. You should also apply good practices such as modularity, encapsulation, abstraction, cohesion, and coupling to ensure code quality and maintainability5.
Testing: This is the process of verifying and validating that the software system meets the requirements and specifications. You should use different types of testing techniques and tools to ensure the functionality, reliability, performance, security, and usability of the system. You should also use test automation tools to reduce manual effort and increase test coverage6. You should also apply test-driven development (TDD) or behavior-driven development (BDD) methodologies to ensure that your code is testable and meets the expectations of the stakeholders7.
Deployment: This is the process of delivering and installing the software system on the target hardware platform. You should use tools and methods that support continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to automate and streamline your deployment process8. You should also consider the configuration management and version control aspects of your software system to ensure its consistency and traceability9.
Maintenance: This is the process of providing support and updates for the software system after its deployment. You should monitor and measure the performance and behavior of the system using tools such as logging, profiling, or analytics10. You should also identify and fix any bugs or defects that may arise during operation. You should also implement changes or enhancements to the system based on feedback from the stakeholders or new requirements.
These are some of the aspects of software architecture that you should focus on to improve your skills in designing complex applications for embedded systems. I hope this helps you in your learning journey. If you want to learn more about software architecture for embedded systems, you can check out some of these books:

Sure, I can elaborate more on architectural design for embedded systems. Architectural design is the process of creating a high-level structure of the software system that satisfies the requirements and follows the architectural principles and patterns. It involves choosing an appropriate architectural style, defining the components of the system, their responsibilities, interfaces, and interactions, and documenting the architectural design using tools such as UML diagrams or architecture description languages.

Some examples of architectural styles for embedded systems are:

Client-server: This style divides the system into two types of components: clients and servers. Clients request services from servers, and servers provide services to clients. This style allows for modularity, scalability, and reusability of components. However, it also introduces communication overhead, latency, and dependency between clients and servers. An example of a client-server architecture for an embedded system is a smart home system, where a central server controls various devices (such as lights, thermostats, cameras, etc.) and communicates with them through a network protocol (such as ZigBee or Wi-Fi). The devices act as clients that send requests to the server and receive commands from it1.
Peer-to-peer: This style distributes the functionality and data among multiple components that are equal in terms of roles and responsibilities. Peers communicate with each other directly without relying on a central coordinator. This style allows for decentralization, fault-tolerance, and load-balancing of the system. However, it also introduces complexity, security risks, and synchronization issues. An example of a peer-to-peer architecture for an embedded system is a wireless sensor network, where each sensor node collects and processes data from its environment and shares it with other nodes through a wireless protocol (such as Bluetooth or ZigBee). The nodes act as peers that cooperate with each other to achieve a common goal2.
Layered: This style organizes the system into a hierarchy of layers, where each layer provides a set of services to the layer above it and uses the services of the layer below it. Layers are separated by well-defined interfaces that hide the implementation details of each layer. This style allows for abstraction, modularity, and portability of the system. However, it also introduces performance overhead, coupling between layers, and potential inconsistency between layers. An example of a layered architecture for an embedded system is an operating system, where each layer provides a different level of abstraction and functionality to the applications running on top of it. For example, a typical operating system may have layers such as hardware abstraction layer (HAL), kernel, device drivers, middleware, libraries, and user interface.

Great!. Right now I am working on Qualcomm's easy mesh application which use all of the above 3 approaches in a single application. It uses client-server architecutre for credential cloning, and steering, where a centralized controller shares the credentials to other AP nodes and also based on algorithms the controller provides insturctions to other nodes to steer clients. easy mesh uses peer to peer architecutre in for building topology database, where all nodes including controller exchange topology information with other nodes to build a consolidated topology database. And overall the implementation  of easy mesh application is done in layered fashion, where the steering algorithm would depend on topology database, which would depend on 1905 service layer etc. I feel all the three approaches are required to develop a real world application, can explain more on how to architect applications like easy mesh which would require mutiple architecture styles combined running in paraller

Thank you for sharing your experience with Qualcommâ€™s easy mesh application. It sounds like a very interesting and challenging project. I agree that sometimes a single architectural style may not be sufficient to capture all the requirements and features of a complex application, and that a combination of multiple styles may be needed. However, combining different styles also introduces some challenges, such as ensuring consistency, compatibility, and coordination among the different components and interactions.

One way to architect applications like easy mesh that require multiple architectural styles is to use a hybrid architecture approach. A hybrid architecture is a combination of two or more architectural styles that are applied to different parts or aspects of the system, depending on their suitability and effectiveness. A hybrid architecture can leverage the advantages of each style while mitigating their drawbacks. However, a hybrid architecture also requires careful design and integration to avoid conflicts or mismatches between the different styles.

Some examples of hybrid architectures for embedded systems are:

Client-server and peer-to-peer: This hybrid architecture combines the client-server style for centralized control and coordination, and the peer-to-peer style for distributed data and functionality. This can improve the scalability, reliability, and performance of the system, as well as reduce the communication overhead and dependency on the server. However, this also requires synchronization and security mechanisms to ensure data consistency and integrity among the peers. An example of this hybrid architecture is the one you mentioned for easy mesh, where credential cloning and steering are done by a central controller (server), while topology database is built by all nodes (peers) through direct communication1.
Layered and event-driven: This hybrid architecture combines the layered style for abstraction and modularity, and the event-driven style for responsiveness and flexibility. This can improve the portability, maintainability, and usability of the system, as well as enable dynamic adaptation to changing conditions or user inputs. However, this also requires clear interfaces and protocols between the layers and the events, as well as efficient event handling and dispatching mechanisms. An example of this hybrid architecture is an embedded operating system that uses a layered structure to provide different levels of services and functionality to the applications, while also using an event-driven model to handle interrupts, signals, timers, or user inputs2.
These are some examples of how to architect applications like easy mesh that require multiple architectural styles combined running in parallel. I hope this helps you in your learning journey.
