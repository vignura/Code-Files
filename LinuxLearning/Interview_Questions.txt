isEven(13) // outputs 0
isEven(12) // outputs 1
Create the function isEven with appropriate output.
Once the function is created, create event/error handlers for an input of 0 and an input of null, which both output -1.
Once finished, recreate the isEven function without using % (modulo) or / (division)."

Given this code, what is the output?

unsint8 x = 0;
While( x < 255) {

    x = x + 2;
    Printf(x);

} 

a)
i = 1
j = i++
Print( j )
Print( i )

b)
i = 1
j = ++i
Print( j )
Print( i )
