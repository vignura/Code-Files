1) What are all the different PCI standards ?
	PCI, PCI-X (PCI eXtended) and PCIe (Express)

2) What is the difference between PCI, PCI-X and PCIe ?
	In PCI and PCI-X are based on parallel bus architecture, where all connected devices
	share the same bus. PCIe follows serial point to point architecture, where each PCIe 
	device will have a dedicated PCIe lane(s). In PCIe, multiple point to point links are 
	handlled by a PCIe switch. PCI and PCI X are half duplex, PCIe is full duplex.

3) What is the Bandwidth of various PCI standards ?
	PCI 	32 or 64 bit wide slots operating at 33 MHz or 66 MHz, so the speed would vary from
		 	132 MB/s to 528 MB/s
	PCIX	64 bit wide slots, also suports 32 bits, operating at 66, 133, 266, 533 MHz, so 
			the speed would vary from 264 MB/s to 4.264 GB/s 
	PCIe	Supports single lane speed from 250 MB/s (PCIe 1.0) to 7.88 GB/s(PCIe 6.0) and
			supports upto 16 parallel lanes

4) How many endpoints are supported by different standards ?
	PCI 	5 endpoints
	PCIX 	5 endpoints
	PCIX 	32 endpoints

5) What is a PCIe switch ?
	PCIe switch is just a switch that switches PCIe packets based on TLP Headers. PCIe switches are
	used to expand PCIe interconnect
6) What is PCIe root complex ?
	The interface between PCIe bus and CPU may contain several buses and chipsets which are collectively 
	called the root complex.

7) What is the physical layer used in PCIe ?
	PCIe uses multi-lane SerDes physical layer using 8B/10B line coding or more efficient line encodings like 64B/66B line coding for the higher speed offerings

1) Why did PCI SIG abandon PCI and PCI-X's parallel bus architecture ?
	This was due the low power signalling (reflected wave signalling) used by PCI, which meant, at 
	high frequencies requires shorter traces and fewer loads. hence PCI at higher frequencies 
	essentialy became a point to point interconnect.

2) How can PCI be compared with SPI, I2C and RS232 ?
	SPI: like SPI, PCI is also synchronous, (data is latched on clock edges); and like SPI
	 	 chip select (CS), PCI has Request/Garnt (REQ/GNT) signals for bus arbitration. But 
	 	 unlike SPI, a seperate Bus arbitrator is required to resolve these REQ/GNT requests.
	 	 PCI uses parallel bus with is 32 or 64 bit width, while SPI is serial so uses 
	 	 a single serial pair (MISO/MISO) which is more like PCIe.
	I2C: PCI bus can have multiple masters and slaves, so PCI uses I2C like address to resolve
		 transcations. Since SPI like REQ/GNT can be used for resolving conflicts between bus
		 masters, I2C like address can then be used to resolve slaves connected to the bus.
	RS322: Like Request to Send (RTS) and Clear to Send (CTS), in RS232, PCI uses Initiator
		   ready (IRDY) and Target Ready (TRDY) signal for flow control.

3) What are the various PCI transcation modles ?
	Programmed IO, DMA and peer to peer (rarely used)

4) What is Bus Arbiter in PCI ?
	Bus Arbiter is the device that grants access to contending PCI master to the bus.

5) What are PCI Disconnect and PCI Retry protocols ?
	Retry: when a PCI target does not have any data, then it can send a stop signal
		   to prematurely end the PCI bus cycle, telling the requester to retry again after 
		   waiting 2 clock cycles. During this wait time the bus arbiter may grant access 
		   to another master.
	Disconnect: when a PCI target does not have all the requested data, then it can send a stop 
				signal to prematurely end the PCI bus cycle, telling the requester to resume again after waiting 2 clock cycles. During this wait time the bus arbiter may grant 
				access to another master.

	both Disconnect and retry protocol improves the efficiency of the PCI bus.

6) what are PCI errors ?
	PCI generates, parity error (PERR) and system error (SERR).
	PCI uses even parity, so when a parity error in data occurs, PERR is asserted and
	when parity error is detected in PCI address, then SERR is asserted, which would
	trigger a Non maskable interrupt to the CPU resulting in "blue screen of death".

1) How many bus, devices and functions does PCI support ?
	256 Buses, 32 devices per bus and 8 functions per device. (2 ^ 8), (2 ^ 5), (2 ^ 3) = (2 ^ 16)
2) What is configuration space in PCI ?
	Each PCI function can have upto 256 bytes of configuration space that provides the
	information which is used during PCI enumaration. For example, Header type 1, may
	indicate that the device connected is a PCI brogde.

3) What are the new PCI X features ?
	Split transcation model:
		In PCI X, requester not just sends address but also excahnges other
		inforamtion such it own address during attribute phase, so if the completer is not able to 
		complete the transcation in the current bus cycle, it will tell the requester to put the 
		transcation in queue and end the bus cycle. Finally, when the completer has requested data,
		it performs a write to the requester this time and transfers the data.
		(split response; split completion).

	MSI: 
		Message Signalled Interrupts, where the PCI-X device initiates a memory write to a
		predetermined address, which understood as interrput, and data of this write contains
		interrupt vector, hence the CPU will direclty now which device interrupted and can 
		jump to the corresponding the ISR with out any decoding effort.

	Strobe: 
		PCIX, in oder to operate at higher clock speeds, introduced new signal called strobe
		along with the data line, the trasmitting device sends both data and strobe which can
		be used for latching the data at receiver end. Here since the strobe and data are 
		propagating through the same path, data sampling errors due to clock skew, 
		which is due to different propogation delyas were eliminated.
		eliminated

1) What is PCIe ?
	PCIe is a successor of PCI and PCI X buses that uses serial point to point link instead of
	parallel shared bus topology, Since PCIe is serial, it only requires a signle lane 
	(TX, RX, diffrential pairs) and no control signals are used. Since PCIe has TX and RX pairs
	it can achieve simultaneous biderictional transfer (full duplex). Like all serial protocols 
	PCIe is also a packet based protocol.

2) Does PCIe retain software backward compatability with older PCI standards ?
	yes, PCIe maintains full backward software compatability with older PCI standards so drivers
	written serveral years ago for PCI will still work with PCIe.

3) What are the various layers of PCIe ?
	PCI Core layer, Transaction Layer, Data Link layer and Physical layer.

4) What is BDF in PCIe ?
	Bus, Device and Function, configuration software is responsible for enumerating every bus, device 
	and function on given topology. Enumeration software uses depth first search for enumeration.

1) What is PCI configuration space ?
	The PCI configuration space is the standard interface through which the software can read and discover the 
	capabilities and the resource requirement of the PCI device (MMIO, IO, using the BARs) so that it (software)
	can allocate it. Usually the configuration space is 256 bytes in size, but it is extended to 4 KB is PCIe.

2) What is PCI enumeration ?
	PCI enumeration is the process by which the software (BIOS / bootloader / kernel OS) discovers the PCI hierarchy, 
	ie, discovers the buses, the devices, and the individual functions in those devices, allocate resources (memory
	by programing the BARs) to those devices so that they can be used by the system.

3) How can a software find the type (Memory or IO) and size of the resource requsted by the PCI function ?
	Again using the BARs (Base Address Registers), the software can find out the type and size of the resource requseted
	by a PCI function. If the 0th bit of the BAR is set, then it is a IO request else it is a memory request. By writing 
	all ones (0xFFFFFFFF) into the register, and reading back the register, the software can discover the size of the 
	request (using the number of zeros returned).

4) How does the software differntiate between a PCI endpoint and a PCI bridge ?
	The software uses the PCI header type field in the configuration space to differentiate a PCI bridge and a PCI endpoint.
	A PCI bridge will have a "Type 1" header and a PCI endpoint will have a "Type 0" header.

5) Describe the software flow of PCI enumeration.
	
	For each domain in the system (max 0xFFFF):
		For each bus in that domain (max 256 buses): 
		 	For each device in that bus (max 32 devices):
		 		
		 		if the device is a endpoint:
					For each function in that endpoint device (max 32 functions):
						find the resource required using BARs and alloate them (ie program the DRAM controller with
						address range available from MIMO range) and program the BARs with allocated base address.
					end

				else
					The device is a PCI bridge, so create a new bus and enumerate it, allocate resorces to it 
					and update the Base and Limit registers.

				end

			end
		end
	end


6) When does PCI enumeration takes place in a PC ? and when in a development board ? what are the differences ?
